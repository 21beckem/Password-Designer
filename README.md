# Password-Designer
There are so many services out there to save all your passwords on, but is that really what you want?

## The Problem
If someone gets access to your password service, they then have access to ALL your passwords. That's a big problem.

## The Solution
The solution is to not have your passwords saved anywhere!

That may sound obvious, or dumb, or both, but here me out.

If you were to type in some information, for instance questions that you might see on a forgot your password screen, then the computer took your answers and scammbled them up into nonsense that you use as your password, your passwords would literally be made from your knowledge about yourself.

# Useage
Long story short, it's not useable yet. Haha. Just a proof of concept :)

But you can still see an example working here: [https://21beckem.github.io/Password-Designer/](https://21beckem.github.io/Password-Designer/)
